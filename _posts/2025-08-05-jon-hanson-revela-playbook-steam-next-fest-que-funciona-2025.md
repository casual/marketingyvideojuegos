# Jon Hanson Revela Playbook Steam Next Fest Que Funciona

Jon Hanson expone harsh reality: "Most devs show up cold a Steam Next Fest y get zero wishlists." Su solution viene desde years observing patterns y developing systematic approach que transforms Next Fest desde passive participation hacia active wishlist generation engine. El playbook prioritizes pre-event optimization y strategic timing rather than hoping para organic discovery durante crowded festival periods.

Key insight drives entire strategy: "Winners engineer wishlist spike before Day 1, entonces let Steam's systems do heavy lifting." Esta approach leverages platform algorithms y momentum rather than competing against thousands de simultaneous demos durante peak festival traffic. Success requires methodical preparation y coordinated execution rather than last-minute participation.

Hanson's framework addresses fundamental problem donde developers treat Next Fest como isolated event rather than integrated marketing campaign requiring sustained effort before, during, y after festival periods. Para indie developers seeking proven strategies, playbook provides actionable roadmap para maximizing Next Fest ROI through systematic preparation.

## Foundation: Store Page Optimization Primero

"Optimize your store page first" represents fundamental prerequisite antes any promotional activities. Hanson emphasizes capsule CTR como "top de funnel conversion driver," recognizing que even perfect demo worthless si players never click through desde discovery surfaces. First 4 screenshots function como "elevator pitch en visuals," requiring strategic curation rather than random gameplay captures.

6-second hover cut creates critical decision point donde "custom beats auto-generated every time." Este brief window determines whether browsers convert a wishlisters, making video quality y immediate hook essential para competitive performance. Generic auto-generated content fails a capture attention en crowded festival environment.

Tag strategy involves using "all 20, lock top 5 a sub-genre" para maximize discoverability while maintaining category focus. Strategic tagging affects Steam's recommendation algorithms y comparative game suggestions, influencing long-term visibility beyond festival periods.

Store page optimization creates foundation para all subsequent promotional activities. Even exceptional demo performance cannot overcome poor store page conversion, making optimization prerequisite rather than afterthought.

## Demo Como Marketing Engine: 80-90% Non-Player Wishlists

"Demo is marketing" reframes traditional thinking about demo purposes. Hanson reveals counterintuitive data: "80-90% non-player wishlists" come desde "people who don't play," mientras targeting "30-90 target minutes" median playtime sweet spot. Esta suggests demos serve discovery function rather than just gameplay validation.

Demo signals quality y arms creators con content, providing social proof y promotional materials beyond direct player engagement. Successful demos generate word-of-mouth y content creator interest even when majority de wishlists come desde non-playing observers.

"Demo complete!" celebration moments create shareable content y milestone achievements que amplify reach beyond direct players. Strategic demo design considers viral potential y content creation opportunities alongside gameplay experience.

Demo timing y presentation affect perception de game readiness y professional polish. Well-executed demos provide credibility signals que influence purchasing decisions y creator collaboration willingness, extending impact beyond immediate Next Fest period.

## Strategic Creator Timing: T-3 to T-1 Pulse

"Stack creator drops T-3 to T-1" creates concentrated momentum pulse que amplifies organic discovery. 72 hours before festival, "concentrate all creator drops here" maximizes algorithmic benefits mientras avoiding competition con festival day noise. Hanson targets "mid creators" con "5K-100K followers" who "convert reliably" rather than pursuing mega-influencers con uncertain engagement.

Press kit preparation includes "short GIF + UTM links en every outreach" para streamlined creator adoption y trackable results. Ready-to-use assets reduce friction para creators mientras enabling performance measurement across different promotional channels.

"Algorithm spike" timing leverages velocity recognition donde "algorithm can amplify" initial momentum into sustained visibility. Strategic concentration creates compound effects rather than spreading efforts across extended timeframes.

Creator coordination requires advance planning y relationship building rather than last-minute outreach. Successful pulse depends en prepared creators ready a execute synchronized promotion durante optimal timing window.

## Niche Fests Como Force Multipliers

Hanson advocates "niche fests como force multipliers," using events como LudoNarraCon/TactiCon para "build 2-7K wishlists first" before major festivals. Esta laddering approach validates demo con "high-fit audiences" mientras building baseline wishlist velocity que improves major festival performance.

Test y learn phase validates demo effectiveness con targeted demographics before broader exposure. Niche festival feedback enables iteration y improvement antes higher-stakes major festival participation.

Next Fest launch benefits desde pre-existing momentum y proven demo performance. Games arriving con established wishlist velocity receive algorithmic advantages versus cold launches competing para initial attention.

Sequential festival strategy builds cumulative effects rather than treating each event como isolated opportunity. Successful campaigns leverage multiple touchpoints para sustained growth rather than single-event dependency.

## 14-Day Field Plan: Systematic Execution

Comprehensive timeline begins T-14 con "demo live" y "trailer under 90s, gameplay en first 5 seconds." T-7 requires "final check" para "confirm creators, A/B test capsule/screens." T-3 to T-1 focuses en "pulse" con "creator drops + start 24/7 broadcast."

D1-D7 emphasizes "execute" con "daily Steam notes, fast triage" para real-time optimization. Post-festival T+1/T+7 includes "analyze" con "results post, micro-patch learnings" para locking higher baseline WL/day performance.

Systematic approach prevents reactive scrambling mientras ensuring critical milestones receive proper attention. Timeline coordination enables team alignment y resource allocation ahead de high-pressure execution periods.

Measurement framework tracks "wishlist velocity," "conversion rates," "demo performance," y "creator impact" para data-driven optimization. UTM tracking y day-by-day deltas provide actionable insights para future festival preparation.

## TL;DR: Momentum Engineering

Hanson's core principles distill a three key strategies: "Don't just attend—arrive con momentum," "concentrate velocity before Day 1, not during," y "optimize everything—booth assets, not just demo scope." Esta systematic approach treats Next Fest como campaign requiring preparation rather than isolated event hoping para organic success.

Playbook challenges common developer assumptions about festival participation mentre providing proven alternative approach. Strategic timing, systematic preparation, y measurement focus create competitive advantages en increasingly crowded festival environment.

Success requires commitment a process rather than hoping para breakthrough moments. Developers following systematic approach position themselves para algorithmic amplification rather than competing purely through content quality en noisy environment.
